# Cluster Scheduler Simulator (CSS)
Cluster Scheduler Simulator (CSS) is a cluster scheduling simulator used for design new scheduling alogrithm in big data analytics cluster.
## Current stage
We generate  `job Queue` and `task Queue` here. Each task has its own processing time. The random generated  `tasks Queue` are mappting to different `job Queue` for scheduling. We use common matrics like Job Completion time (JCT), Fairness, etc to evaluate the scheduler performance.
